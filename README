NAME
    Sort::MergeSort - merge pre-sorted input streams

SYNOPSIS
     use Sort::MergeSort;

     my $terator = mergesort($comparefunc, @iterators);

DESCRIPTION
    Given a comparison function and a bunch of iterators that produce data
    that is already sorted, "mergesort()" will provide an iterator that
    produces sorted and merged data from all of the input iterators.

    Sort::MergeSort also works with filehandles. It doesn't care. If it's
    only input is a filehandle, it will return a filehandle. In all other
    situations it will return an iterator.

    The $comparefunc takes two arguments. It does not use the implicit $a &
    $b that perl sort uses.

    The iterators are treated as file handles so any filehandle or
    Sort::MergeSort::Iterator will do as input.

EXAMPLE
     use Sort::MergeSort;
